# Square1-Optimizer

Original program was taken from https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/square1.htm#progs

Modifications:
- Perhaps a solution is found at a depth of 5, if you want to search further, you are now prompted to do so
- Pieces can be ignored
- The solver can attempt to solve using only (U and R2) or (D and R2)
